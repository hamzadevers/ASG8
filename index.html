    <h2 id="abt">About Me </h2>
    <p>
      I am a motivated and hardworking individual with practical experience in
      customer service and e-commerce operations. I have worked in a UK-based
      call center where I handled a high volume of daily calls and assisted
      customers with their queries and claims. During this role, I learned how
      to communicate clearly, stay calm under pressure, and provide professional
      service to every customer. I am patient by nature and always try to
      understand customer concerns before offering a solution. Handling
      continuous calls helped me improve my listening skills, problem-solving
      ability, and confidence in speaking English. I am comfortable working in
      fast-paced environments and meeting daily performance targets. Along with
      call center experience, I also have hands-on experience in e-commerce
      order processing. I worked as a drop shipper where I managed daily orders
      from eBay and placed them through AliExpress. This role helped me
      understand order accuracy, shipment tracking, and the importance of timely
      delivery. I learned how small mistakes can affect customer satisfaction,
      so I always focus on details. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree
      in Business & Information Technology (BBIT) from Virtual University. This
      program is helping me build strong knowledge in computer systems, IT
      tools, and business processes. I am eager to apply this knowledge in
      real-world work environments and continue improving my professional
      skills. I am a quick learner and easily adapt to new tools, systems, and
      work policies. I take feedback positively and always try to improve my
      performance. I believe in teamwork, discipline, and punctuality, and I
      take my responsibilities seriously. In my free time, I enjoy cooking,
      learning about new technology and gadgets, video gaming, and gardening.
      These activities help me stay creative, focused, and mentally refreshed.
      My goal is to grow professionally, gain more industry experience, and
      become a reliable and valuable part of any organization I work with.
